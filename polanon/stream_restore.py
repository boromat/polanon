r"""Restore original values inside a streamed response without breaking tokens across chunks.

A provider streams arbitrary fragments, so ``<OSOBA_1>`` can arrive as ``<OSO`` + ``BA_1>``. The
restorer buffers any trailing fragment that could still grow into a token and emits the rest.

A model may write a person's token with the case the sentence needs after a colon, as in
``<OSOBA_1:wołacz>``; the name then comes back declined, as :func:`restored` describes.
