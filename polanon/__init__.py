"""polanon: reversible PII anonymization for LLM calls, Polish-first. Zero web/DB dependencies.

This package is deliberately self-contained, so it can be dropped into any project: a CLI tool, a
LangChain callback, an MCP server, an Open WebUI filter. It imports no web or database framework,
and nothing from the hub built on it (enforced by tests/test_layering.py).

Public API (stable):

    from polanon import Anonymizer, default_guards

    anonymizer = Anonymizer(default_guards(with_ner=False))
    result = anonymizer.anonymize_sync("Jan Kowalski, PESEL 50810112354")  # or: await .anonymize()
    result.anonymized        # "<OSOBA_1>, PESEL <PESEL_1>"
    result.mapping           # {"<OSOBA_1>": "Jan Kowalski", "<PESEL_1>": "50810112354"}
    Anonymizer.restore("Dzień dobry <OSOBA_1>", result.mapping)   # original back in the answer
    restorer = Anonymizer.stream_restorer(result.mapping)         # for token-by-token streams

    turn = anonymizer.turn(known=["Klub Orlik"])   # one call: history, question, tool results
    messages = turn.mask_messages(history)         # Anthropic or OpenAI messages, one mapping
    turn.mask_data(tool_result)                    # MaskingUnavailableError: send nothing
    turn.restore_data(tool_input), turn.restore(answer), turn.stream_restorer()

Runtime dependencies of the core: the standard library only. `NerGuard` needs spaCy and a language
model, the remote judges need httpx, and both are imported lazily so neither is required to mask
identifiers.
