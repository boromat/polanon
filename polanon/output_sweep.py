Two things are worth flagging. The model may invent a token that was never allocated, which means it
hallucinated a reference. It may also emit brand new personal data that nobody sent it. Neither
blocks the answer; both are logged and shown as a hint.

    A detection counts as new only when some letter or digit of it lies outside every known value
    and every token in the answer. Comparing whole strings reported the conversation's own data as
    new whenever a guard read it with a trailing full stop, read part of it, or read two known
    values as one name.

    A known value counts as known exactly as written; only a name — a person, an organisation or a
    place — also counts with the letters Polish glues onto its right when they spell a case ending:
    a restored answer says "Jan Kowalskiego" where the mapping holds "Jan Kowalski", and the ending
    the token took on is not personal data the model invented. A letter glued onto any other kind of
    known value changes it ("ul. Długa 5a" is another building), so those stay reported. The
    extension never crosses digits and never reaches left, so a known number inside a longer one
    and a name that starts inside another ("Joanna" beside "Anna") are still new.
