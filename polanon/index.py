"""Masking for search indexes: the documents, the questions, and the store of what tokens hide.

A retrieval-augmented application masks its documents before they are embedded and stored, and
masks every question the same way, so the question finds the passages about the same person. That
takes stable tokens, from an :class:`~polanon.Anonymizer` built with
:class:`~polanon.pseudonyms.Pseudonyms`. The masked passages go to the embedder and the index; what
each token stands for goes to a :class:`MappingStore`, which the application keeps apart from the
index, encrypted. Nothing that names a value is written to the index.

A passage found later is restored with the store, or exactly as written with the mapping kept for
it, and so is a model's answer, also while it streams.
